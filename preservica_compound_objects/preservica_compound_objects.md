# Overview
## Problem Statement
In the past, when an ArchivesSpace archival object consisted of multiple folders, and these folders were ingested into Preservica, a separate digital object was created for each folder. This workflow is not compatible with the syncing of materials in Preservica with the Digital Collections System (DCS).
## Goals
Provide Digital Special Collections and Access (DSCA) and Digital Preservation Systems (DPS) staff with a report of archival objects in ArchivesSpace which have multiple Preservica digital objects. DPS staff will use this report to run a resync process with ArchivesSpace whereby a single digital object will be created for all digitized folders. SCMS staff will use this report to delete the existing digital objects from ArchivesSpace.
